I decided to upload all of my small projects related to a udemy course. If you want to try it youself follow the link:
https://www.udemy.com/course/100-days-of-code/

I'm including small games, hints about functions, methods, moduls that might help you solve some issues.

I decided to upload all the tasks so I can improve my github experience and help other beginners.

You are welcome to download or use any of the codes.
