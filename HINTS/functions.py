# FUNCTIONS

# "from" is to import custom functions. It is used like the example below:
 

# To get the number of characters in a string we use the len() function.
# name = input()
# print(len(name))


# Printing numbers as a string
# num = 5
# print(str(num) + " printed as a string")

# Absolute Value of a number
# my_num = -3
# print(abs(my_num))

# In this example the code is executing first the input, then it changes the input with the the text provided by the user. Then it adds the rest ot the print statement.
# print("Hello " + input("What is your name?") + "!")


# Function "pow" is gonna give us two peaces of information. "POWER". The first is a number and the second is the power that i wanna take that number to.
# print(pow(5, 2))

# Function "max" is gonna tell us which number is bigger
# print(max(6, 5))

# Function "min" will give us the lower number
# print(min(4, 6))

# Function "round" will round the numbers. Meaning will show us the higher number depending which is closer to the lower or higher number
# print(round(7.6))


# from functions import func_name(func_name is the name of the custom function)


# sorted() function is to sort dictionary in order of values for example


# clear() to clear the latest output
