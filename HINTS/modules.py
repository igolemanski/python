# Module "random" is used when we need randomply generated number. We need to use it with its own functions like "random.random()" or "random.randint()" etc.
# random_integer = random.randint(1, 10)
# print(random_integer)



# Module "math" is used for different types of calculations. It is used with its own functions like "math.ceil()" etc.
# import math
# def paint_calc(height, width, cover):
#     num = math.ceil((height * width) / cover) 
#     print(f"You'll need {round(num)} cans of paint.")
    
# test_h = int(input("Enter wall height: ")) # Height of wall (m)
# test_w = int(input("Enter wall width: ")) # Width of wall (m)
# coverage = 5
