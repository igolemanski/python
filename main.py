# "floor" function will get the lower number and will chopoff the decimal point.
# To get access to some specific functions, they need to be imported with the sentence "from math import *". Some of the functions are "floor", "ceil" etc.
# from math import *
# print(floor(6.7))
# "ceil" function will get the higher number and will chopoff the decimal point.
# print(ceil(1.6))
# square root of a number we get with the function "sqrt"
# print(sqrt(36))


# GETTING INPUT
# name = input("What is your name: ")
# age = input("How old are you: ")
# print("Hello, " + name + "!" " You are " + age + "!")


# CALCULATOR GAME
# num1 = input("Enter number 1: ")
# num2 = input("Enter number 2: ")
# result = float(num1) + float(num2)
# print(result)


# Mad libs GAME
# car = input("Enter you car brand: ")
# model = input("Enter the model of your car: ")
# engine = input("Enter the engine size: ")
# color = input("What is the color of your car: ")
# motorcycle = input("What is your motorcycle: ")
# motorcycle_model = input("What model it is: ")
# motorcycle_engine = input("The engine size is: ")

# LISTS. How lists work. In lists we use parenthesis []. We can change the value in lists. For example friends[1] = "Madonna"
# friends = ["Gosho", "Jivko", "Ico", "Nasko", "Svetlio"]
# print(friends[1])
# print(friends[0:2])
# friends[2] = "Koko"
# print(friends[2])


# LIST Functions
# lucky_num = [4, 8, 101, 16, 23, 42]
# friends = ["Gosho", "Jivko", "Ico", "Nasko", "Svetlio", "Pesho", "Pesho"]
# Extend function
# friends.extend(lucky_num)
# Append function
# friends.append("JOJO")
# Insert function
# friends.insert(2, "Simo")
# Remove function
# friends.remove("Nasko")
# Clear function. This will remove all elements from the array(list)
# friends.clear()
# To remove the last element from the array. Or we can specify the element in the parenthesis
# friends.pop()
# To check if an element is in the array
# print(friends.index("Pesho"))
# To check how many elements are repeating in the array(list)
# print(friends.count("Gosho"))
# To sort a list in alphabetical order
# Copy function
# friends2 = friends.copy()
# print(friends2)
# print(friends)


# TUPLES -storing data structure. The values can not be changed because in tuples we use parenthesis (). If we try to change it with coordinates[1] = 10, we will get an error.
# coordinates = (3, 5)
# print(coordinates[1])


# FUNCTIONS. To create a function we use "def". To run trough the function we need to call it, by using the last line on say_hi()
# def say_hi(name, age):
#     print("Hello " + name + "." " You are " + age + " old.")
#
# say_hi("Ivo", "37")
# say_hi("Nikol", "30")

# Exercise
# def vehicles(brand, model, year):
#     print("What car you've had: " + brand + " " + model + ". " + "Year: " + str(year))
#
# vehicles("Opel", "Astra", 1998)
# vehicles("Hyundai", "i40", 2014)


# RETURN STATEMENT. return will give us information back from a function(Like a value or a statement). After the return statement we are not allowed to add any other code. Basically it breaks us out of the function.
# def cube(num):
#     return num*num*num

# IF STATEMENT. It is based on conditions.

# DICTIONARIES. Allows to store information: key_value_pairs. Dictionaries are working with the curly brackets only {}. We can sign different type of "keys" like in the example below.

# FOR LOOP. After "for" we basically create variable that will loop trough every symbol(letter or number or anything) in the quotation marks and it will print it in different row.
